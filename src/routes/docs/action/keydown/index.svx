# Keydown

Execute a function on `keydown`. Pass in a map of key names to functions to execute the function on key.

- See also: [use:keyup](/docs/action/keyup)

## Usage

A common use case is to add keyboard shortcuts, e.g. to close a modal with the escape key.

```svelte
<script>
	import { keydown } from 'svu/action';
	let modal = true;
	let close = () => (modal = false);
</script>

<div on:keydown={{ Escape: close }}>
	<!-- your cool modal contents -->
</div>
```

## Options

This action has one option:

### `keys`

A map of keycodes to functions to execute.

- Optional: no
- Type: `{ [key: string]: Function }`
- Default value: none

## Events

This action does not dispatch any events.

## Caveats

keyboard modifiers (shift, ctrl, alt, meta) are not yet supported.

If you need to handle a function on keyup see [use:keyup](/docs/action/keyup). If you need something to happen while the key is pressed down you can use keydown and keyup in conjunction with each other.
