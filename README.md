# SVUTIL

A collection of various useful Svelte utilities curated by nikolai-cc.

It consists of _utilities_, _actions_, _stores_ and _components_ that I have found to make my life in Svelte projects a bit easier.
Unused utils are not imported into your project except if they are relied on by other utilities.
